                <h3>3. Jaguar</h3>
                <p>
                    The jaguar (Panthera onca) is a large cat species and the only living member of the genus Panthera native to the Americas.
                    With a body length of up to 1.85 m (6 ft 1 in) and a weight of up to 96 kg (212 lb), it is the largest cat species in the Americas and the third largest in the world.
                    Its distinctively marked coat features pale yellow to tan colored fur covered by spots that transition to rosettes on the sides, although a melanistic black coat appears in some individuals.
                    The jaguar's powerful bite allows it to pierce the carapaces of turtles and tortoises, and to employ an unusual killing method:
                    it bites directly through the skull of mammalian prey between the ears to deliver a fatal blow to the brain.
                    The modern jaguar's ancestors probably entered the Americas from Eurasia during the Early Pleistocene via the land bridge that once spanned the Bering Strait.
                    Today, the jaguar's range extends from extreme southern Arizona and New Mexico in the United States across Mexico and much of Central America,
                    the Amazon rainforest and south to Paraguay and northern Argentina. It inhabits a variety of forested and open terrains,
                    but its preferred habitat is tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest, wetlands and wooded regions.

                <h3>2. Lion</h3>
                <p>
                    The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India.
                    It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic;
                    adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides.
                    A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates.
                    The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.
                    The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight.
                    During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa, Southeast Europe, the Caucasus, and Western and South Asia,
                    but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India.
                    It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s.

                <h3>1. Tiger</h3>
                <p>
                    The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera.
                    It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates such as deer and wild boar.
                    It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring.
                    Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, then become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.
                    The tiger was first scientifically described in 1758 and once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin in the east,
                    and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands. Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range
                    and have been extirpated from Western and Central Asia, the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China. Today, the tiger's range is fragmented,
                    stretching from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent, Indochina and Sumatra.
