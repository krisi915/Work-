                    Tigers are not domesticated cats. None of the six surviving species of tiger (another three are extinct) should be kept as pets.
                    A majority of states in the U.S. have instituted bans on keeping any of the big cat species as pets.
                    Tigers are huge, strong, fanged predators that eat dozens of pounds of meat per day and need acres of expensive high-security enclosures.
                    The risk of attack far outweighs any benefit, which makes tigers not suitable as pets at any age.
                    However, if you are curious, here are some details about what it's like keeping these large cats living alongside humans.

                <h3>Legality</h3>
                <p>
                    Most states have restrictions on owning many exotic pets including big cats, especially around heavily populated communities.
                    Specifically, 35 states have bans on keeping big cats, while 21 states ban all dangerous exotic pets.
                    Check the laws in your area before attempting to acquire a tiger or any other big cat;
                    The Big Cat Public Safety Act is pending federal legislation aimed at prohibiting private citizens from owning big cats.

                <h3>Ethics</h3>
                <p>
                    Tigers belong in the wild, ideally. In captivity, tigers can fare well within spacious zoos or big cat rescue preserves,
                    but they are not well adapted to be healthy or happy in a house with an ordinary yard.

        <div class="thingsToConsider">
            <h3>Things to Consider</h3>
            <p>
                Pet enthusiasts cannot give a tiger the life it needs because it has adapted over eons to inhabit spacious wildlands in specific
                geographic regions. Keeping a tiger in a small space such as a house or yard can place the tiger's life, and its keepers' lives, in danger.
                It is a better idea to visit tigers in a zoo where you can observe and enjoy their presence in a safer and more natural setting.
            </p>
            <h3>Tiger Behavior and Temperament</h3>
            <p>
                Tigers are large, strong, and dangerous cats. They have the ability to take down a 500-pound running antelope,
                are strong swimmers, and are extremely territorial. In the wild, male tigers will cover a territory of up to almost 40 miles;
                females cover roughly a seven-mile territory. Males mark their territories by spraying urine and dropping feces in strategic locations.
                Tigers typically live solitary lives except for mating and periods of time when mothers are raising cubs.
                Although tiger cubs are small and cute, in their first year alone they will grow to hundreds of pounds and have canine teeth and
                claws that are inches long. Tigers should never be declawed, as they use their claws for walking.
                Removing their large teeth would also prevent them from being able to effectively eat their food.
                Many tigers are carefully and strategically trained to be around people and will go years without incident,
                but you cannot effectively predict the behavior of a tiger—they are still wild animals at heart.
                Famous trainers have been mauled and killed by their beloved tigers, even after working with them daily for years.

                <h3>What Do Tigers Eat and Drink?</h3>
                <p>
                    The amount of food needed for a tiger will vary with gender and age, but an adult tiger may consume up to 88 pounds of meat
                    at one time antelope, gazelle, water buffalo, deer, and fish comprise a tiger's diet.
                    But, these opportunistic carnivores will eat just about any animal they can catch.

            <h3>Purchasing a Tiger</h3>
            <p>
                According to Big Cat Rescue, a tiger cub is at the top of the price range for exotic cats, at around $7,500.
                Big Cat Rescue also advises that owners should expect to spend up to $20,000 for a cage sufficient to house a full-grown tiger,
                let alone the cost of the wide landscape this large predator will require in order to thrive.
